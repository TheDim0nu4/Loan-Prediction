# Loan Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing data about loan approval and building a machine learning model to predict loan approval based on client information. 
The project includes EDA, preprocessing the data, training machine learning models, then evaluating and comparing their performance. 
It also has a simple console application where a client can enter their own data and see the loan result.
